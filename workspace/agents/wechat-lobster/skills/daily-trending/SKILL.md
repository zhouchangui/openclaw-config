## Data Collection

### Multi-Platform Trending Lists (Required)

- Zhihu Hot List: `/n/mproPpoq6O`
- Weibo Trending: `/n/KqndgxeLl9`
- Baidu Real-time Hot Topics: `/n/Jb0vmloB1G`

### Fetching Strategy

**⚠️ Important: To avoid context overflow, fetch in batches with character limits!**

**Option A: Local API Script First (Recommended)**

```bash
python3 ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/fetch_tophub.py --platforms weibo,zhihu,baidu --limit 5
```

**Option B: Core Platforms via web_fetch**
```bash
# Fetch only 2-3 core platforms, limit each to 1500 characters
web_fetch("https://tophub.today/n/KqndgxeLl9", maxChars=1500)  # Weibo
web_fetch("https://tophub.today/n/mproPpoq6O", maxChars=1500)  # Zhihu
web_fetch("https://tophub.today/n/Jb0vmloB1G", maxChars=1500)  # Baidu
```

**Option C: Complete Fetch (Use only when necessary)**
```bash
# Weibo Trending
web_fetch("https://tophub.today/n/KqndgxeLl9", maxChars=2000)

# Zhihu Hot List
web_fetch("https://tophub.today/n/mproPpoq6O", maxChars=2000)

# Baidu Hot Topics
web_fetch("https://tophub.today/n/Jb0vmloB1G", maxChars=2000)

# 36Kr
web_fetch("https://tophub.today/n/Q1Vd5Ko85R", maxChars=2000)

# Huxiu
web_fetch("https://tophub.today/n/5VaobgvAj1", maxChars=2000)
```

**Fetching Strategy:**
1. Prioritize Weibo + Zhihu + Baidu (covers 90% of hot topics)
2. Only fetch other platforms if suitable topics are not found in these 3
3. Fetch one platform at a time, filter immediately, then decide whether to fetch the next

### Filtering Criteria (Critical)

From all platform trending lists, filter out **truly important topics that are genuinely at the center of discussion**:

1. **Major Events**: Significant policies, international relations, social events
2. **Hot Discussion Topics**: Topics that spark widespread discussion and debate
3. **True Focus Points**: Not celebrity gossip or promotional content
4. **Facts Only**: Exclude subjective commentary headlines like "sky is falling", "worst ever", "absurd", etc.
5. **Factual Content**: Keep the events themselves without added commentary or sensationalism

**Exclude:**
- Headlines with subjective commentary
- Pure entertainment gossip
- Obvious promotional content
- Emotional expressions

**Include:**
- Factual events
- Policy updates
- Socially debated topics
- Truly discussion-worthy focal points

**Output Requirements:**
- Each news item must be complete with clear beginning and end
- Describe events like news headlines
- Avoid single words or incomplete fragments

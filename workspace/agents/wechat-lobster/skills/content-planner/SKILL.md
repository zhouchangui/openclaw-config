# Topic Planning + Content Calendar

## Use Cases

- User says "Help me plan next week's official account content"
- User says "What trending topics can I write about recently"
- User says "Help me create a content calendar"
- User wants to know what competitor accounts are writing about
- Need to make topic decisions based on data

## Script Directory

This skill's scripts are located in `${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/`, where `SKILL_DIR` is the directory containing this SKILL.md file.

| Script | Purpose | Usage |
|--------|---------|-------|
| `scripts/search_wechat.js` | Sogou WeChat article search | `node ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/search_wechat.js "keyword"` |

### Search Script Parameters

```bash
# Basic search
node ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/search_wechat.js "keyword"

# Limit result count
node ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/search_wechat.js "keyword" -n 15

# Save to file
node ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/search_wechat.js "keyword" -n 20 -o result.json

# Parse real URLs (extra network requests, may be blocked by anti-scraping)
node ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/search_wechat.js "keyword" -n 5 -r
```

**Dependencies:** Node.js + cheerio (`cd skills/content-planner/scripts && npm install`)

**Output Fields:** Article title, article URL, article summary, publish time, source account name

## Workflow

### Step 1: Clarify Planning Scope

Confirm the following information with the user (ask all at once):

```
Help you plan content, let's confirm a few things first:

1. Planning period? (This week / Next week / Custom time range)
2. Any specific directions or keywords you want to write about?
3. How many articles per week? (Default refers to max_articles_per_week in config)
```

If `config/config.json` already has `account.field` (domain/field), automatically use the field as search context without asking again.

### Step 2: Trending Scan

Execute multiple rounds of searches covering different dimensions:

**Search Strategy:**

1. **Core domain keyword search** — Search with 2-3 core keywords related to `account.field`
2. **User-specified keyword search** — If user has specific directions
3. **General trending search** — Search with combinations of "trending", "hot", "latest" with domain keywords

```bash
# Example: Tech domain
node ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/search_wechat.js "AI latest trends" -n 10
node ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/search_wechat.js "large model applications" -n 10
node ${SKILL_DIR}/scripts/search_wechat.js "tech trending 2026" -n 10
```

Wait appropriately between each search to avoid triggering anti-scraping mechanisms.

If `browser` tool is available, can also browse industry news websites to supplement materials.

### Step 3: Competitor Analysis

Extract the following information from search results:

| Analysis Dimension | Extracted Content |
|-------------------|-------------------|
| Title Strategy | Which title patterns (suspense/numbers/comparison/rhetorical) get high engagement |
| Topic Direction | Which directions are recent hot topics concentrated in |
| Content Angle | What angles do existing articles take, how can we differentiate |
| Publish Time | Competitors' publishing frequency and timing patterns |

### Step 4: Generate Topic Recommendations

Based on trending data and competitor analysis, generate 5-10 topic suggestions. Each topic must include:

```
## Topic Recommendations

### 1. [Topic Title Direction]

- **Alternative Titles**:
  - Title A (Suspense style)
  - Title B (Number style)
- **Target Audience**: [Specific group]
- **Content Angle**: [Differentiation point — How we differ from competitor articles]
- **Recommended Style**: deep-analysis / practical-guide / story-driven / opinion / news-brief
- **Urgency**: 🔥 Urgent (publish within 24h) / 📅 This week / 📦 Reserve
- **Reference Articles**: [Related article titles + links found in search]

### 2. [Topic Title Direction]
...
```

**Topic Quality Requirements:**
- Each topic must be based on real search data, not fabricated
- Each topic must have a clear differentiation angle (cannot write the same thing as searched articles)
- Must include at least 1 high-urgency topic (🔥) and 2 reserve topics (📦)

### Step 5: User Approval

**This is a mandatory approval gate and cannot be skipped.**

Present the topic list to the user and ask them to:
1. Select topics to keep (multiple selection allowed)
2. Adjust titles, angles, styles (optional)
3. Determine schedule (which day to publish which article)

### Step 6: Generate Content Calendar

Based on user approval results, generate `content_calendar.json` and save to `config/` or the path specified by `config.paths.calendar`.

**Content Calendar JSON Format:**

```json
{
  "week": "2026-W11",
  "created_at": "2026-03-06",
  "account": "Official Account Name",
  "articles": [
    {
      "id": 1,
      "date": "2026-03-09",
      "day": "Monday",
      "topic": "Topic Title",
      "angle": "Differentiation Angle",
      "style": "deep-analysis",
      "audience": "Target Audience",
      "urgency": "this-week",
      "status": "planned",
      "keywords": ["keyword1", "keyword2"],
      "reference_urls": ["Reference Article URL"]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Status Field Descriptions:**
- `planned` — Scheduled, not started writing
- `drafting` — Writing in progress
- `review` — Pending review
- `ready` — Ready to publish
- `published` — Published

### Step 7: Output Confirmation

```
Content calendar generated!

📅 2026-W11 Content Plan
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━

| # | Date | Topic | Style | Urgency |
|---|------|-------|-------|---------|
| 1 | Monday | ... | deep-analysis | 🔥 |
| 2 | Wednesday | ... | story-driven | 📅 |
| 3 | Friday | ... | practical-guide | 📦 |

Saved to: content_calendar.json

Next step: Send "write article 1" or "start writing Monday's article" to trigger article-writer.
```

## Search Considerations

- Search results may be empty (anti-scraping restrictions or no keyword matches), retry with different keywords
- The `-r` parameter for parsing real URLs makes extra requests with low success rate, avoid unless necessary
- Search tool is for learning and research purposes only, not for large-scale scraping
- Multiple searches in short time may trigger restrictions, recommend 3-5 second intervals between searches

## Integration with Other Skills

- The generated `content_calendar.json` is the input source for **article-writer**
- article-writer reads entries with status `planned` from the calendar, updates to `drafting` → `ready` after completion
- publish-orchestrator reads entries with status `ready` for publishing
